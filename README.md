# FROM — Financial, Resources & Operations Management

> A comprehensive platform for **Financial**, **Resources**, and **Operations** management. Built with React, TypeScript, and SQLite for food truck and single-location businesses (e.g. a food truck).

## What is FROM?

**FROM** stands for **F**inancial, **R**esources, and **O**perations **M**anagement. This system is organized around those three pillars:

| Pillar | What it covers |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Financial** | Cash sessions, sales, expenses, reports, revenue, profit, and KPIs |
| **Resources** | Inventory, raw materials, purchases, suppliers, recipes (BOM), and FIFO lot tracking |
| **Operations** | Day-to-day flow: sessions (open/close), point of sale, kitchen workflow, users, and access control |

### Key Features

- **💰 Financial** — Cash session management, sales, expense tracking, financial reporting and dashboards
- **📦 Resources** — FIFO inventory, raw materials, purchases, suppliers, recipes (BOM), automatic cost calculation
- **⚙️ Operations** — Point of sale, kitchen view, user roles (Admin / Cashier / Kitchen), session-based workflow
- **👥 Authentication** — Secure login with role-based access control
- **📱 Responsive Design** — Modern web interface that works on all devices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd from
   ```

- Verify Node.js version (18+ required)
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**Login issues:**
- Verify demo credentials: admin@from.com / password
- Check browser console for authentication errors
- Clear browser cache and cookies

**Database errors:**
- Check from.db file permissions
- Verify SQLite database integrity
- Review server logs for detailed error messages

### Performance Optimization
- Regular database maintenance with VACUUM
- Index optimization for frequently queried data
